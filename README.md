- Python Random Module: For generating random numbers and selecting random elements.

## How to run
***PROCESS 1*** : The bot is hosted on our server.
- Join the discord server from this link : [Join Server](https://discord.gg/CXhnyqqNUK)

- Enjoy through the features of the beloved camel.

If this doesn't work(sometimes it may have to be reset), then:

***PROCESS 2*** : You can enjoy riding the camel through the replit platform.

- Go on the replit codespace using : [Camel_Replit](https://replit.com/join/rwmdalmern-harshgupta2300)

- Join the discord server from this link : [Join Server](https://discord.gg/CXhnyqqNUK)

- Run the main python file.

- Enjoy through the features of the beloved camel.



## Deployment
The bot is deployed on Replit. Simply run the main script on the Replit platform to start the bot or just join the discord server. THE BOT IS HOSTED ON THE SERVER.
We tried running a python script but to keep it alive 24/7, but due to replit restrictions it did not work.
## Applications of Idea
