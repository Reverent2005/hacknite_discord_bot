Problem Statement:
Develop a Discord bot on the theme arcade that offers various fun features and games to users within a Discord server.

Goal:
The goal of CamelBot is to enhance user engagement and interaction within the Discord server by providing entertaining games, useful commands, a currency(camel coin) which can be used to bet upon and win surprising roles from the store, and more.

Features:
•Camel Coins System: Users can earn and spend virtual currency (Camel Coins) within the server.
•The user gets 100 coins as a joining bonus which can be used for playing games and betting upon.
•STEAL! - Using the $steal command, you can try to steal camel coins from people. There is a possibility that you rob accurately, or you may end up losing some money yourself.
•Games: CamelBot offers several games such as Hangman, Number Guessing Game and  7 Up 7 Down.
•Utility Commands: Commands for checking balances, giving coins, and viewing the leaderboard.
•Hear a random joke.
•Use $camelhelp for commands info
•Interactive Experience: Users can play games and interact with the bot in real-time.
•Shop roles from the store and enjoy exclusive benefits in the games.
